The input file must be placed on the same firectory of WallE.exe (Debug foldder).

WallE.exe is run through the command prompt. 
	Change directory to the location of WallE.exe
	Type : WallE.exe test.txt <Search Method>
	Here search methods can be DFS, BFS, AS, GBFS, CUS1 and CUS2 (Any other input would not give a solution)
	Output format would be as follows,
		test.txt A* 138
		Right; Down; Right; Right; Right; Up; Up; Right; Right; Right
